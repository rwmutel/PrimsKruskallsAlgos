# Prims and Kruskals Alogrithms Comparison

Doing this lab we implemented Kruskal's (R. Mutel) and Prim's (M. Ruzak) minimal spanning tree algorithms.
We run multiple tests on graphs with different density and analyzed the time complexity of the given algorithms.
Also we compared their efficiency with the networkx implementations.
Detailed report is in the Ukrainian language and enclosed in the repo.

## Main results:

### All algorithms:

![All algos on the half-complete graph](/figures/Half_complete_graph.png)

### Only NetworkX algorithms (considering them the most efficient possible implementations):

## Summary

An interesting lab task showing how to apply theoretical math knowledge
